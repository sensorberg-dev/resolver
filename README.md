#Resolver
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sensorberg-dev/resolver.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sensorberg-dev/resolver)

The Resolver is a microservice that you can run in your own infrastructure or hosted by us, resposible for delivering all neccesary data to the SDKs in order for them to map a beacon the the attached content.

The Resolver runs standalone as a [Spring boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) application.

Simply run

```
./gradlew run
```
to have your own instance.

#Dependencies

###Elasticsearch

An instance of [elastic search](https://www.elastic.co) needs to be available on your machine, or available to your machine.

```
brew install elasticsearch
elasticsearch --config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml

```
You might need to change the connection string in the Resolver in */src/main/resources/application.properties*

```
elasticsearch.connectionString=http://localhost:9300/elasticsearch_brew
spring.jackson.date-format=com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.util.ISO8601DateFormat
apiKey.largeCompany=10000
```
The name of the cluster, when installing from brew is elasticsearch_brew

###Microsoft Azure

The resolver writes JSON data into a Azure Event Hub. The properties of the Event Hub connection are stored in the application.properties file.

```
connectionfactory.SBCF=amqps://{ServiceBus name}.servicebus.windows.net?amqp.idleTimeout=120000

property.connectionfactory.SBCF.username={username}
property.connectionfactory.SBCF.password={password}

queue.EventHub={eventHub name}

```

#Standalone

Once build, the jar artifact can be run standalone. *java -jar service-resolve.jar* and off you go!
```
 ./gradlew build

:compileGroovy UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:jar
:bootRepackage
:assemble
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE

```

### Change port

You can change the port of the running Spring Boot Application by adding/changing the following Entry to the file application.properties

```
server.port=8090
```

### Change log level

You can change the log level of the Spring Boot Application by adding/changing the following Entry to the file application.properties

```
logging.level.com.sensorberg=DEBUG
```

### Change ElasticSearch Connection String and Index

You can change the ElasticSearch Connection String and the Index in the application.properties

```
elasticsearch.connectionString=http://localhost/:9300/elasticsearch_xyz
elasticsearch.indexName=beacon_layout

```

Alternative you can set these properties to the Java VM at the startup of the Spring Boot Application

java -jar service-resolve.jar -Delasticsearch.indexName=beacon_layout -Delasticsearch.connectionString=http/://localhost/:9300/elasticsearch_xyz

Setting properties via VM overrides the settings of the application.properties.
